        <p class="text-2xl mt-4 text-center sm:text-left text-dark">My name is Peter Xiao, and I'm currently a sophomore in Montgomery Blair High School's STEM Magnet Program. I'm interested in working with <span class="text-blue-900">computer science</span>, <span class="text-blue-900">cybersecurity</span>, and <span class="text-blue-900">math</span>. Recently, I've also specifically done more work with AI and math modeling. Check out my <span class = "text-purple-900">Projects</span> page if you want to see more! Outside of academics, I enjoy playing video games, chess, guitar, golf, and karate.</p>
