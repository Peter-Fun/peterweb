    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Peter Xiao, and I'm currently a sophomore in Montgomery Blair High School's STEM Magnet Program. I'm interested in working with computer science, cybersecurity, and math. Recently, I've also specifically done more work with AI and math modeling. Check out my Projects page if you want to see more! Outside of academics, I enjoy playing video games, chess, guitar, golf, and karate.</p>
